# Instructions

Use this PACE strategy document to record decisions and reflections as you work through this end-of-course project. You can use this document as a guide to consider your responses and reflections at different stages of the data analytical process. Additionally, the PACE strategy documents can be used as a resource when working on future projects.

# Course Project Recap

Regardless of which track you have chosen to complete, your goals for this project are:

- Complete the questions in the Course 2 PACE strategy document
- Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file
- Complete coding prep work on project's Jupyter notebook
- Summarize the column Dtypes
- Communicate important findings in the form of an executive summary

# Relevant Interview Questions

Completing the end-of-course project will help you respond these types of questions that are often asked during the interview process:

- Describe the steps you would take to clean and transform an unstructured data set.
- What specific things might you look for as part of your cleaning process?
- What are some of the outliers, anomalies, or unusual things you might look for in the data cleaning process that might impact analyses or ability to create insights?

**Reference Guide**

This project has three tasks; the visual below identifies how the stages of PACE are incorporated across those tasks.

**Data Project Questions & Considerations**

![](RackMultipart20231115-1-751dmb_html_fefaecd2c33c3b07.png) **P**** ACE: ****Plan Stage**

- How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?

Get access to data.

Clean the data from outliers, null values

Do an EDA

- What follow-along and self-review codebooks will help you perform this work?

Jupyter notebook

- What are some additional activities a resourceful learner would perform before starting to code?

Get in touch with the TLC team to some clarification if neeeded

Coummunicate with the data team for some guidance, insights

- Will the available information be sufficient to achieve the goal based on your intuition and the analysis of the variables?

Found some unusual values for taxi fair for a short distances. This could be an anomaly or may be reason behind it. Further investigation required.

- How would you build summary dataframe statistics and assess the min and max range of the data?

df.info()

df.describe()

Methods will give you the required information

- Do the averages of any of the data variables look unusual? Can you describe the interval data?

**Note** : The Construct stage does not apply to this workflow. The PACE framework can be adapted to fit the specific requirements of any project.

- Given your current knowledge of the data, what would you initially recommend to your manager to investigate further prior to performing exploratory data analysis?

- What data initially presents as containing anomalies?

- What additional types of data could strengthen this dataset?
